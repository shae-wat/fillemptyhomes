Join us in our historic effort to pass a Vacancy Tax so we can provide the City with 4,500 new homes and raise an estimated $38 million annually for homeless prevention and affordable housing.

More than 40,000 homes — nearly 1 in 10 residential units — are vacant in San Francisco, a city with a long-standing housing affordability crisis, where 10,000 people are living on the streets. Since 2015, the rate of vacant residential housing has increased by 20%, according to a January 2022 BLA report. The fastest growing category of vacant units is units purchased but never occupied, including investor-owned properties.

The Empty Homes Tax will tax owners of buildings of three units or more, where a residential unit has been vacant for more than six months in a given year. The tax rate is higher for larger units, and it increases the longer a home is kept vacant.

The Empty Homes Tax is modeled after a residential vacancy tax passed in Vancouver in 2016, which is credited with bringing more than 18,000 units online since it went into effect. If San Francisco were to adopt a tax based on the Vancouver model, the city could see an activation of around 4,500 units within two years. In addition, the tax is projected to raise $38 million annually.
