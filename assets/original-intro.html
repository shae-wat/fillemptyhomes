    10% of San Francisco homes sit empty. Join our movement and let’s do
    something about that.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Over 40,000 homes — nearly 1 in 10 — sit empty in San Francisco while 10,000
    folks live on the streets and countless others are priced out of the city.
    It is time to change that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Join us in our historic effort to pass a Vacancy Tax in San Francisco so we
    can provide the City with an estimated 4,500 new homes and raise an
    estimated $38 million annually for homeless prevention and affordable
    housing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sign up to be part of our movement so we can fill empty homes with people
    and fight back against the endless real estate speculation that is driving
    up the rent.
